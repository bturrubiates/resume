Résumé
======
A friend and I were discussing how annoying it was to maintain an up to date
résumé. I decided that someday I'd write a little YAML->LaTeX converter. Then I
remembered that I could use pandoc as a simple templating engine. This is now
the current revision of my résumé and in the future will hopefully have outputs
in LaTeX, HTML, Markdown, and plain text.

Dependencies
============
Currently requires pandoc and latexmk.

How to Build
============
Just use the included Makefile. To generate a PDF generated by LaTeX:
```
make pdftex
```
